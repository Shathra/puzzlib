# Puzzlib

Python library for various puzzle games

## Introduction

I like trying to solve puzzles. Often I think how I make computer solve them and I have programmed some traditional puzzles before. So I just thought that a library which helps me design, generate and solve various puzzles would be nice. That is the starting point of this project.

I'll go with iterative design process. Starting from a puzzle game, I'll code a small library for it and implement the game and then I'll start coding a new puzzle game and I'll expand the library to add extra functionalities needed for new game. And it will continue like that.

I do not want to limit myself with any particular puzzle type. For a starting point, I'll try to implement puzzles in these links:
